# IPC Map

**Author:** `Ahmed Farouk`

The IPC Map is one of the five key maps in our project, leveraging the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) framework. This framework categorizes population's regions into five phases based on the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition:

- **Phase 1**: Minimal
- **Phase 2**: Stressed
- **Phase 3**: Crisis
- **Phase 4**: Emergency
- **Phase 5**: Famine

This classification helps visualize and analyze food insecurity worldwide.

## **IPC Map Views**

### 1. World View

This view is displayed when no specific country is selected:

- IPC data is visualized globally with red gradients indicating the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition.
- Countries without IPC data are shaded in gray.
- A gradient legend is displayed, showcasing the number of people in **Phase 3 (Crisis)** and above, measured in millions.
- Hovering over countries triggers a tooltip that includes:
  - Country name.
  - Date of analysis.
  - Validity period.
  - Number and percentage of people experiencing severe food insecurity.

### 2. Country View

This view is displayed when a specific country is selected.

- The **selected country** is highlighted with detailed IPC data, while regions without available data are shaded in gray.
- Regions are categorized into 6 main phases, as indicated in the displayed legend:
  1. **Phase 1**: Minimal
  2. **Phase 2**: Stressed
  3. **Phase 3**: Crisis
  4. **Phase 4**: Emergency
  5. **Phase 5**: Famine
  6. **Phase 6**: Not Analyzed Data
- Includes two accordions displaying:
  - **Food Security**
  - **Malnutrition**

## **Technical Overview**

The IPC Map is rendered using the `IpcChoropleth` component, which integrates two main subcomponents:

1. **World View**: Handles global visualization.
2. **Country View**: Focuses on a selected country's regions data.

### 1. World View

The **World View** is managed by the `IpcGlobalChoropleth` component, which serves as a wrapper for the `GeoJSON` component to display global IPC data. This view is loaded using the following key properties:

#### **Data Processing with `generateColorMap`**

The `generateColorMap` function is crucial for associating IPC data with map features:

- It maps IPC data to geographic features using their IDs.
- Processes the data into a format compatible with the `GeoJSON` component.

Hereâ€™s the function breakdown:

```typescript
static generateColorMap = (ipcData: CountryIpcData[], mapData: CountryMapDataWrapper) => {
  const ipcDataById = Object.fromEntries(ipcData.map((data: CountryIpcData) => [data.adm0_code, data]));
  const updatedFeatures = mapData.features.map((feature: CountryMapData) => ({
    ...feature,
    properties: {
      ...feature.properties,
      ipcData: ipcDataById[feature.properties.adm0_id],
    },
  }));
  return { type: 'FeatureCollection', features: updatedFeatures as Feature<Geometry, GeoJsonProperties>[] };
};
```

This function ensures that IPC data aligns with geographic regions and prepares the data for visualization.

#### **Layer Styling**

Layer styling is managed using the `style` property of `GeoJSON`. Two cases are handled:

1. **World View**: The layer is styled based on IPC data using a red gradient.
   - This is handled by the `ipcGlobalStyle` function, which uses a switch-case structure to assign appropriate colors.
2. **Country View**: Non-focused regions are styled in gray, while the selected country displays detailed IPC data.

#### **Interactivity with `onEachFeature`**

The `onEachFeature` property adds interactivity to map layers:

- **Tooltips**: Populated by the `createTooltip` function, displaying:

  - Country name.
  - Date of analysis.
  - Validity period.
  - Severity and percentage of affected populations.

- **Mouse Events**: Managed by the `attachEvents` function, enabling:

  - Hover effects for highlighting countries.
  - Tooltip display and hide functionality.
  - Click events for selecting countries.

### 2. Country View

The **Country View** is managed by the `IpcCountryChoropleth` component, which serves as a wrapper for the `GeoJSON` component to display detailed IPC data for a selected country's regions. This view is loaded using the following key properties:

#### **Data Processing**

The `fetchCountryData` function is used to retrieve IPC region data for the selected country. This data is then processed to prepare it for rendering:

```typescript
if (selectedMapType === GlobalInsight.IPC) {
  try {
    const newIpcRegionData = await countryRepository.getRegionIpcData(
      selectedCountryData.properties.adm0_id
    );
    const hasIpc = newIpcRegionData.features.some(
      (feature) => feature.properties?.ipcPhase !== undefined
    );
    setIsDataAvailable(hasIpc);
    if (newIpcRegionData && newIpcRegionData.features) {
      setIpcRegionData({
        type: "FeatureCollection",
        features: newIpcRegionData?.features as GeoJsonFeature<
          Geometry,
          GeoJsonProperties
        >[],
      });
    }
  } catch {
    setIsDataAvailable(false);
  }
}
```

#### **Layer Styling**

Layer styling in the Country View is managed by the `fillCountryIpc`. This function assigns styles to regions based on their `ipcPhase` level. Non-focused regions are displayed in gray, while the selected country's regions are color-coded according to their IPC phase.

#### **Interactivity with `onEachFeature`**

The `onEachFeature` property adds interactivity to the regions within the selected country:

- **Hover Effects**: Managed by the `attachEventsRegion` function, enabling:
  - Highlighting of regions when hovered.

#### Accordions

Two expandable accordions are displayed based on the selected country:

- **Food Security**
- **Malnutrition**

These accordions are generated using the `getFoodSecurityAccordionItems` function. They display information such as:

- Country population.
- Number of people with insufficient food consumption.
- Percentage of acute malnutrition in children.

If no data is available, a **No data available** message is shown.
