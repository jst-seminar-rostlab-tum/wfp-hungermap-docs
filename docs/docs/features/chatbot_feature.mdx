Author: `Ahmet Selman Güclü`

The chatbot feature in the HungerMap provides a new way to interact with the data of the platform, enhancing user experience beyond the traditional interface. It also allows users to interact with reports, unlike the first version of the HungerMap, where users could only download and read them manually.

### Interacting with the Chatbot

1. **Opening the Chatbot**: Click the chatbot button to open the chat window.
2. **Writing Prompts**: The chatbot provides example prompts to help users get started. Users can also type specific queries about anything regarding the HungerMap.

**Example Prompts:**

- `Can you provide an overview of Morocco?`
- `Can you provide a detailed comparison of the regions of Morocco creating a table with the specific regions?`

### Accessing Report Data

The HungerMap includes a Download Portal for accessing various reports, such as Year-in-
Review and Country Reports.

1. **Navigating the Download Portal**: Access the Download Portal via the bottom of the sidebar.
2. **Using the Chatbot with Reports**: Each report has a chatbot button that opens the chat window for a specific report with a welcome message.

#### Example Interactions with Reports

- **Summarizing Reports**: Start by asking the chatbot for a summary of a report. For instance, `Can you provide a summary of the Yemen report?` The chatbot will deliver a concise overview.
- **Extracting Specific Data**: Users can request specific information from reports. For example, `The report talks about 22 regions that are considered high risk or moderate risk in Yemen. Which countries are these?` This allows for quick data retrieval without manual searching.
- **Comparing Data Trends**: Users can ask the chatbot to compare different data trends within a report. For example, `Can you make a comparison between the trends of the insufficient food consumption and the trends of food-based coping strategies. How do they differ for each country? Provide the information in a table`

### Conclusion

The chatbot in the HungerMap introduces a new way to interact with the data of the platform, a significant enhancement in how users interact with data. By leveraging conversational queries, users can quickly access summaries, detailed comparisons, and specific data points, making data exploration more efficient and user-friendly.
