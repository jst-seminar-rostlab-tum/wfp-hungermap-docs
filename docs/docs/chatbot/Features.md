Upon triggering the chatbot, you will be greeted with three predefined default prompts.

## Limitations
While the HungerMap Chatbot offers a range of useful features, there are some limitations that users should be aware of:

### Inability to Rename Chats
Currently, the HungerMap Chatbot does not support the ability to rename individual chat sessions. This means that all chat sessions are identified by default names or contents, which can make it challenging to quickly identify specific conversations, especially if you have multiple ongoing chats. This limitation can impact the user experience by making it harder to organize and manage chat histories effectively.

### Inability to Delete Chats
Another limitation is the inability to delete individual chat sessions. Once a chat is created, it remains in the chat history indefinitely. This can lead to cluttered chat histories, making it difficult to find relevant information or manage ongoing conversations. Users may find this particularly inconvenient if they want to remove outdated or irrelevant chats from their history.

### Inability to Stop Chatbot Responses
The HungerMap Chatbot currently does not provide an option to stop or cancel a response once it has been initiated. If the chatbot takes too long to generate a response, users are left waiting without the ability to interrupt the process. During this time, users can only wait or navigate to other parts of the website. This limitation can be frustrating, especially when timely information is needed.

### Summary
These limitations highlight areas where the HungerMap Chatbot could be improved to enhance user experience. The ability to rename and delete chats, as well as the option to stop or cancel responses, would provide users with greater control over their chat sessions, allowing for better organization and management of conversations. Despite these limitations, the chatbot remains a valuable tool for accessing information related to hunger and food security.
