# How to add a new GA event

**Author:** `SÃ¡muel Fekete`

You don't have to register events at all, you can just send any event with the following code snippet. Add this to wherever you want to send the event (e.g. when a state value changes in a context).

```typescript
window.gtag('event', 'event_name', params);
```

Replace `event_name` with the name of the new event. `params` can be any JavaScript object to send as optional parameters. It can also be omitted.

If you want to check whether the event is working, trigger the event and check the Realtime overview Report on the GA dashboard. You should see the event after a few seconds. However, to better visualize data, it is recommended to create a custom exploration for each event (type). To do this, go to Explore, then create a Blank exploration. Select the needed dimensions (usually Event name) and metrics (usually event count, etc.). To show only some type of events, add a filter to the event name at the bottom of the Settings section.
