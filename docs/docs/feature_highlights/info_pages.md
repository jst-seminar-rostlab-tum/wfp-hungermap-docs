# Info pages

Author: `Jakob Sch√∂dl`

To help users understand what the HungerMap is and how it works, it contains
multiple [Info Pages](/docs/frontend/info_pages). Those go into detail on the used data sources and technologies. The
same information is also accessible using [tooltips](/docs/frontend/tooltip) throughout the map.

We worked on making this information more accessible by summarizing the explanations and improving the way they are
shown to the user.
