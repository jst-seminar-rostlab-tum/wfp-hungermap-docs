# Map Intro

## Overview
The map leverages [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) to create an interactive visualization platform for displaying country-level data and geographic insights.
It integrates data layers, choropleths, and user interactions to dynamically update views and provide contextual information.
The map consists of several core components that are located in ```src/components/Map```.
```Map.tsx``` is the [main component](map_component.md) responsible for the map functionality using several other components.
